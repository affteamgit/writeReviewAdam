* [Paragraph 2: Casino age & Extra Products]:Only If the casino is older than 5 years, mention this as a good thing (for example, this can mean they have experience and have been able to stand the test of time, they have been doing something right, the gambling industry is very fast-moving and often risky, so an ‘older’ casino is a good sign, they have had more time to tighten up security, fix vulnerabilities, build safer systems, such casinos usually also have a more refined UI, less bugs, smoother gameplay, more games, exclusive partnerships, a more reliable payout speed and consistency, etc).For every benefit you mention, explain again why this benefit should matter to the reader and provide an example. Use short sentences, maximum 20 words per sentence. If the casino is not older than 5 years - DO NOT MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT ITS AGE.

* Only If the casino’s look isn’t modern, explain how that can negatively affect the reader (for example, not keeping a brand up to date with modern style can mean a lack of care or a general challenge with keeping the brand competitive, etc.). For every benefit you mention, explain again why this benefit should matter to the reader and provide an example. Use short sentences, maximum 20 words per sentence. If the casino has modern look - DO NOT MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT ITS LOOK BEING MODERN OR NOT.If none of the above are true, skip the second paragraph.
* [Paragraph 3: Restrictions & Chat Availability]:Check how many countries the casino restricts and if the casinos restricts over 40 countries, warn the reader to double-check if they’re eligible to play to avoid trouble, and recommend one or two other brands from the Top Casinos that restrict less than 40 countries. If the casino restricts less than 40 countries - DO NOT MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT RESTRICTED COUNTRIES.
* Only If the casino’s live chat is not available 24/7, warn the reader about it.

* [Paragraph 4: Website Usability]:Only If the casino has any annoying pop-ups, warn the reader about it, otherwise DO NOT MENTION IT. While some players don’t mind pop-ups, especially if that means getting more promotions, most people find them disrupting. Only If the casino has any broken images or links, tell the reader that you found some, which is a sign that the casino hasn’t quite managed to get their site under control yet. This can mean a lack of care or a general challenge with keeping the brand working at 100%, if the casino has no broken images or links - DO NOT MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT BROKEN IMAGES OR LINKS.
