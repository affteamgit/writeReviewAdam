* [Paragraph 1: Number of games and providers]:State the number of games and game providers in the casino, then comment on the numbers based on the following criteria (but do not mention the criteria): anything over 7000 games is a lot, anything below 5,000 games is low and can be improved, everything in between is average. More than 70 game providers is a lot, anything below 40 providers is not a lot, everything in between is average. When commenting focus on benefits or drawbacks for the reader. For every benefit you mention, explain again why this benefit should matter to the reader and provide an example. Use short sentences, maximum 20 words per sentence.
* [Paragraph 2: Provably fair games]:State whether the casino has provably fair games or not. If it does, comment how this can benefit the reader (for example, this can give the players a chance to use the provably fair feature to test the game fairness themselves, and not just rely on 3rd party institutions that test RNGs for all other games). For every benefit you mention, explain again why this benefit should matter to the reader and provide an example. Use short sentences, maximum 20 words per sentence. If the casino doesn’t have provably fair games, recommend a casino that has provably fair games, taken from the Top Casinos.
* [Paragraph 3: In-house games]Only If the casino has in-house games, state this and commend the casino on this by stating how in-house games can benefit the reader (for example, with in-house games the casino shows preparedness to go the extra mile to offer their players something new and unique, in-house games are usually modern, fast-paced games, where casinos can even offer exclusive in-house promotions in, making for a much more diverse and unique user experience, etc.). For every benefit you mention, explain again why this benefit should matter to the reader and provide an example. Use short sentences, maximum 20 words per sentence.
 If the casino does not have in-house games - DO NOT MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT IN-HOUSE GAMES.
* [Paragraph 3: Game filters]: ONLY If game filters are not working properly, warn the reader about it and explain what exactly is the problem and how that can be a drawback. Offer another brand as an alternative that has all game filters working properly, taken from the Top Casinos with properly working filters.
