- Be professional when writing and go straight to the point. Do not use vague words or phrases you would not use in an office. Max 40 words per paragraph.
- Write sentences up to 20 words.
- Do not use the same transition or phrase repeatedly. Vary phrasing between reviews.
- Avoid starting paragraphs with the same 2–3 words across reviews.
- Vary sentence rhythm: mix short punchy sentences with longer flowing ones.
- Talk like you’ve played there - real opinions, real tone.
- If something sucks, say it. If it shines, brag about it.
- Wherever you mention self-exclusion, additional responsible gambling tools, cooling-off option, without or with contacting support, bold the feature or phrase using Google Docs formatting (**bold**). Only bold the features - not the whole sentence.
- No fake politeness. You’re here to help the reader avoid garbage.
- When comparing to other casinos, always start the sentence with "In comparison" or "For example", so that it is clear that the reviewed casino is being compared to another casino; always accompany comparisons with values for the compared casino from Top and Similar Casinos columns.
- Use “I” and “you” — make it personal, and make it count.
- Instead of "players" or "users", use "you" - For example, instead of "This feature benefits players" use "This feature benefits you".
- Do not address the reader at the beginning of the paragraphs.
- Do not disclose your emotions about the casino features.
- When comparing casino information to a criteria, never mention the criteria itself.
- Wherever you mention a brand name in comparison, add an internal link next to the compared casino (the links are provided next to Top and Similar casino names).
- Never use Em dash ("—").
- Occasionally, when the reviewed casino is doing something right, give it a compliment in this fassion: "I’ve got to hand it to (casinoname)...", "Hats off to (casinoname)...", "I really like this about (casinoname)..." (use more similar, but different phrases - do not be repetitive).
- Only mention broken images and links or annoying pop-ups IF the casino has them. If the casino does not have them, do not mention anything about broken images or links or annoying pop-ups. This is because we do not want to mention negative features where there are none.
- ALWAYS wrap the phrase to be bolded using **double asterisks**.
- ALWAYS insert links using [Text](https://example.com) format.
- Never use raw links like [https://example.com].
- If you are comparing casinos, always mention the name as [CasinoName](https://link).
- Never write only the link without wrapping it.
