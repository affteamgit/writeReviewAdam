* [Paragraph 1: Cryptocurrencies and buying crypto]:
* State how many cryptocurrencies casino accepts. If the casino accepts more than 15 cryptocurrencies, say that this is an above average number and offer 1 more brand that accepts similar or more cryptocurrencies from Similar Casinos. If the casino accepts less than 5 cryptocurrencies, say that such a low number can hardly qualify the casino to be called a ‘crypto casino’. If the casino accepts 5 to 15 cryptocurrencies, say that this is an average number found in most crypto casinos. If the casino accepts less than 15 cryptocurrencies advise the reader to double-check that their currency is supported and recommend 1 or 2 casinos that accept more cryptocurrencies taken from the Top Casinos. 
* If you can buy crypto in the casino, mention that the casino supports this, which despite not being ideal for buying crypto this way due to additional fees, it can still be less hassle if you run out of crypto and don’t have to move back and forth between the casino and an exchange. If the casino offers crypto conversion, mention it as something very unique and useful. Very few casinos offer this and it can mean that players can play with virtually any token that’s supported by the conversion tool. They can also deposit in one cryptocurrency and withdraw in another.
* If none of the above are true, skip the first paragraph. 
* [Paragraph 2: By day, week, month withdrawal limits]:Explain how friendly are the casino's withdrawal limits by listing all limits available (by day, by week, by month) and commenting which are very good, very bad, or could be better based on the following criteria:Daily limits: anything over $3,000 is considered good and anything below $2,000 is considered not so good.Weekly limits: anything over $12,000 is considered good and anything below $8,000 is considered not so good.Monthly limits: anything over $24,000 is considered good and anything below $16,000 is considered not so good. If any BTC values appear, convert them internally to USD before comparing them to other casinos, but do not mention USD in the review text. Only mention the BTC amounts.
* [Paragraph 3: Withdrawal time]:State the withdrawal time (we aim for a neutral comment and a heads up to the reader): For casinos with withdrawal time less than 12 hours, when mentioning how long it takes, use randomly one of the following responses - a matter of hours; Within a couple of hours; up to a few hours.

Explain why fast withdrawal time should be important to the reader, how the reader benefits from this. For every benefit you mention, explain again why this benefit should matter to the reader and provide an example. Use short sentences, maximum 20 words per sentence. ONLY If the casino’s withdrawal time is not less than 12 hours, mention a brand with faster withdrawal time from Top Casinos.
